Leaf Disease Detection and Health Grading System(AIML)

PROBLEM DOMAIN:

Leaf disease detection and health grading system is a domain that involves
using various technologies to detect plant diseases and grade the health of plants
based on their visual appearance. This domain is important for the agriculture
industry to detect plant diseases at an early stage and take necessary measures to
prevent the spread of the disease and improve crop yield.

POTENTIAL FOR AI IN THE PROBLEM DOMAIN WITH INDUSTRIAL RELEVANCE:

AI can play a crucial role in this domain by providing accurate and efficient
disease detection and health grading of plants. With the help of computer vision
and machine learning techniques, AI can analyse images of plant leaves and
accurately detect diseases and grade the plant health. This can save time and
effort for farmers and increase the efficiency of disease detection.

STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM:

The problem in this domain is to develop an automated system that can
accurately detect plant diseases and grade the plant health based on the images
of the plant leaves. The system should be able to detect a variety of plant
diseases and provide a grading system that can help farmers take necessary
actions to prevent the spread of the disease.

OBJECTIVES:

1. To develop an automated system that can accurately detect plant diseases and
grade plant health based on leaf images.
2. To provide an efficient and accurate disease detection system for farmers to
prevent disease spread.
3. To provide a grading system that can help farmers take necessary actions to
improve the health of plants and increase crop yield.

DATASET DETAILS:

The dataset used for this problem domain should contain images of plant leaves
with different diseases and different levels of health. The dataset should be
diverse enough to cover a wide range of plant diseases and leaf conditions. The
dataset can be collected from various sources such as field surveys or lab
experiments.

METHODOLOGY:

The methodology for developing a leaf disease detection and health grading
system involves collecting a diverse dataset, pre-processing the images,
developing a deep learning model using computer vision and machine learning
techniques, and testing the model on new images to evaluate its performance.
The system can be deployed as a web or mobile application to make it
accessible to farmers.

EXPECTED OUTCOME:

The expected outcome of this project is to develop an accurate and efficient
system for detecting plant diseases and grading plant health based on leaf
images. The system should be able to provide a fast and reliable disease
detection and grading system for farmers to take necessary actions to prevent
disease spread and improve crop yield.
